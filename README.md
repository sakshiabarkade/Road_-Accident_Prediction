# Road_Accident_Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict the severity of road accidents based on a    comprehensive dataset that includes features like accident location, weather conditions, time of
day, and road type. 
The goal was to build a predictive model that could assist in understandingthe factors influencing road accident severity and help in decision-making for road safety improvements.
